#set imap_check_subscribed

# How often to check for new mail (time in seconds).
# From the FAQ.
#  After every keyboard input mutt updates the status of all folders. To receive "New mail in ..." notifications even without needing to press a key, set $timeout == time to wait for idle mutt (no key pressed) before the status is updated again as if a key were pressed. To avoid too frequent folder access (bad connections via NFS or IMAP), set $mail_check == minium time between 2 scans for new mail (external changes to folders) in case of high keyboard activity.
# 
#     $mail_check < $timeout : scan on next update $timeout < $mail_check : update before scan
# 
# This means $mail_check < $timeout is more useful, because by the time mutt will update, it will also scan for external changes to incorporate them in the update. 
set mail_check = 300
set timeout = 301

# Allow Mutt to open a new IMAP connection automatically.

# Keep the IMAP connection alive by polling intermittently (time in seconds).
