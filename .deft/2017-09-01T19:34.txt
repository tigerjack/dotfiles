SystemNotes


*** Structure
xmonad -> .xmonad/xmonad.hs
xmobar -> launched by xmonad (see), config in .config/xmobar/.xmobarrc
twmnd  -> .config/twmn
yeganesh + dmenu -> launched by xmonad (see), history file in .local/share/yeganesh
xbindkeys -> to associate keyboard keys to actions, see .xbindkeysrc.scm
xss-lock -> subscribes the systemd-events suspend, hibernate, lock-session, and unlock-session with appropriate actions (run locker and wait for user to unlock or kill locker).
feh -> For background, stores last command inside .fehbg
xournal -> config file is at .xournal/config
wmctrl -> interact with the EWMH compliant X Window Manager (i.e. XMonad)
xdg_menu -> better check
	    update-menus to update the list of menu entries

dotfiles_mgmt -> personal alias to manage my important files using git. To use it just use dotfiles_mgmt instead of git in normal commands (f.e. dotfiles_mgmt commit -m "Hello")
mimeinfo -> better of xdg-open when no Desktop Environment. Sample usage mimeinfo -n <file> to open file with default app, mimeinfo -d <file> to select default app for file

*** general settings
** Appearence
GTK2 -> lxappearance -> .gtkrc-2.0
GTK3 -> lxappearance -> .config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
qt5 -> qt5ct (you have to set the QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME="qt5ct" env variable first)

** Sound
pulseaudio -> GUI -> pavucontrol
	   -> tray -> pasystray
	   -> CLI -> pacmd - Used to reconfigure a PulseAudio sound server during runtime.
	      	     pactl - Used to control a running PulseAudio sound server.
		     	   Example usage.
			   To see the list of sinks run
			      pactl list short sinks
			   To set the default sink run
			      pactl set-default-sink <sink-id>
			   To see the list of running client using a sink run
			      pactl list short sinks-input
			   To switch the default sink for a sink-input run
			      pactl move-sink-input <sink-input-id> <sink-id>
	      	     pamixer - A client for a running PulseAudio server, i.e. a mixer
		     	       I mainly use it for its simplicity to increase/decrease volume or toggle mute
*** Test modifications
Added /usr/bin/ethtool to /etc/mkinitcpio.conf in order to disable wake on lan
